# introduction

- WELCOME!
- introduce yourself, share background with R, and with C

    - we all learn differently, we all make mistakes, the goal is collaborative learning, I'm still learning myself
    - normalise

# Check in (15 minutes)

- What road blocks did you run into? How did you work through them.

# discuss lecture / exercises (30 minutes)

- Any issues getting started / setup?
  - I found 
- "Who wants to walk us through how they approached an exercise?
- "Anyone else solve it differently?"

- lecture thoughts
- exercise thoughts
	- debug
	- half
	- prime (I didn't do this one yet)

# moving forward / next week (10 minutes)

## structure of the course

How is this feeling for people? It seemed that the "section" video actually seems to think we'd run through the problem set before watching, I haven't looked at the problem set as yet, but I was wondering how people feel about this?

- Week 1: Watch "Lecture" video (2.5 hr)
- Week 2: Watch "Shorts" (~6 x 10-15 min videos that expand on topics in the lecture) and do one or more of the [additional practice](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/practice/) problems for the corresponding week
- Week 3: Watch "Section" (~1hr video going beyond the lecture) and do one or more of the remaining additional practice problems
- Week 4: Meet to share solutions to the practice problems. Optional: Do "Problem Set" and submit if doing course for credit, or if you want to receive an automatic grade to check your progress

## Next week (week 2)
